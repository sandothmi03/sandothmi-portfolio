                            <p>During my 3-month internship, I gained hands-on experience in various aspects of 
                                system management and business operations. My role involved system implementation, 
                                where I helped configure and deploy new systems, as well as data entry and system maintenance 
                                tasks to ensure optimal performance and accuracy. I was responsible for troubleshooting technical 
                                issues and performing regular updates to maintain system efficiency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to these technical responsibilities, I had the opportunity to learn 
                                about human resources (HR) processes. This included managing employee records, 
                                supporting recruitment activities, and assisting with onboarding and training. 
                                The internship provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how IT and HR 
                                departments work together to support organizational goals. Overall, this experience 
                                significantly enhanced my technical skills and business acumen, preparing me for a future 
                                in both technical and organizational roles.

                        <div class="story">
                            <p>I participated in a 2-day Python workshop where I successfully completed an exam 
                                and developed a functional calculator using the Tkinter library. This experience 
                                introduced me to the fundamentals of building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python, 
                                enabling me to create interactive applications that handle user inputs and provide dynamic feedback. 
                                Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of designing and implementing 
                                GUIs using Tkinterâ€™s widgets and layout options.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, the workshop expanded my skills in data visualization by teaching me 
                                how to draw graphs using libraries such as Matplotlib. This allowed me to translate 
                                complex data sets into easy-to-understand visuals. Overall, the workshop sharpened my Python 
                                technical skills and broadened my understanding of its versatility in developing both user-facing 
                                applications and analytical tools. It was a valuable learning experience that equipped me with 
                                practical skills for creating intuitive and interactive Python applications.
